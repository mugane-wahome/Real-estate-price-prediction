# Madrid-Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
This is a supervised learning model which predicts the price of Real Estate in Madrid, Spain.

Data collected from [Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirbektoktogaraev/madrid-real-estate-market)

The dataset consist listings from popular real estate portals of Madrid. I first cleaned the data in excel and then imported it to R.


After looking through the data its easy to see that there are 145 unique areas in the data-set.
Then i added a sq_ft coloumn in the data and a buy_price_per_sq_ft coloumn to get an idea of the buy price. Because the buy_price can depend on a lot of factors and thus will be varied but buy_price_per_sq_ft gives a glimpse into the variability of the data.

Now, since i am interested in the buy price, i plotted buy_price_per_sq_ft with the number of data points to check if our data is normal or not.

As we can see from the plot, our data is bi-modal, so we cannot perform Linear Regression on our data, because normality is a condition for Linear Regression.
So, we will perform [Quantile Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile_regression).

Then I cleaned the data some more and removed all the NA's, NAN's & INF's, converted text coloumns to factors and then all the columns to numerics.

Then I checked the correlation of independent variables and removed those which had a correlation-coefficient greater than 0.7.

Then I plotted the buy price vs number of rooms to get a general view of my data and see if their were outliers.

Plotted a histogram for the dependent variable.

And a paired scatter plot of the independent variables to see correlation.

Then we divide the data into Test and Train & use the Train data to train our model.
When the quantile regression is done we do the AIC check to make sure our model is not over-fitted and then we get our final model.

Now we use our model to predict the Test set values and check the accuracy of it.
We do so by plotting a gain curve.

A relative Gini score close to 1 means the model sorts responses well.
And since our relative Gini score is 0.94 we can say that our model predicts well and thus is a good fit.

Now we try to make a web page in R Shiny, which can be used to predict the price of the property in madrid (in Euro) through our model.

This is how our webpage looks.
